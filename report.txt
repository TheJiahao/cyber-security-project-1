Flaws from OWASP 2021

A01:2021 – Broken Access Control:

A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures:
Passwords and tokens are transmitted over HTTP in clear text.
To fix it, configure HTTPS for the server to transmit encrypted passwords and tokens.

A03:2021 – Injection:
<Link to source>
The user profile page displays user-submitted description as raw HTML which is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).
To fix it either sanitize user input before saving to database or escape dangerous symbols, such as "<" and ">", in the description string before showing it.
In this project the latter is easier because the template engine provides the utility.

A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures:
<Link to source>
Passwords are stored as clear text. Additionally authentication requests have no rate limits.
Therefore brute force attacks are possible.
To fix the clear text problem, store only hashed version of passwords. For example, use bcrypt to hash the password.
To prevent brute force attacks, use a slow hash function, like bcrypt, in authentication.
The bcrypt can be configured to run slow, such as 200 ms each time, for automated attack but fast enough for real users.

A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):
